<p>Amira Ounzar: This summer I Went to morocco. My family and I went to multiple citys. Such as Casablanca, Marrakesh, Tagazuit and Agadit. My paternal grandmother is from casablanca, thats where my father was raised. Multiple times in our visit we went to sunday market, I still don't know why it's called that, it's open every day. The market is know  as the souk, and it is often where the locals can find all their nesssities. In the beach in Tagazuit we went jetskying and rode horses. My family trip is one to remember.</p>

<p>Sadeeqa Klair: So this summer I went to Houston and I stayed with my cousins and my sister learned how to drive.
Then, they came to my house and we went boating and we went to six flags.
This summer was really productive but slow at the same time. We bought an aboveground pool. And we set it up in the begining of summer, but it was alot of work to put away.</p>

<p>Sobia janjua: I did absolutely nothing. I went on no vacation or nothing fun. I went talking to my friends on discord, watching YouTube, cleaning my room, and stuff.
There were a lot of bestie that I unfriended and many that I friended. Most of them were fake bestie except for Sarinah. Sarinah was a nice bestie who got her phone taken away, but after a while she got it back. After some time passed I started to miss a main bestie, Tiba. Tiba transferred to a different school, and she has no besties there. I talked to her over the summer telling her to be a nice bestie. </p>
